During my internship at Oasis Infobyte, 

I successfully completed four key tasks in graphics design:

Poster Design: Crafting visually captivating posters for various campaigns and events, ensuring effective communication of key messages.

Logo Creation: Developing unique and memorable logos that encapsulated the essence of each brand, aligning with their identity and vision.

Business Card Design: Designing professional and visually appealing business cards that represented the brand identity and facilitated networking opportunities.

Infographic Creation: Creating engaging and informative infographics to visualize data and convey complex information in a clear and concise manner.

These tasks provided invaluable hands-on experience, allowing me to enhance my skills and contribute effectively to the company's marketing efforts.
